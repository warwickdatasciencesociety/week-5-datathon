# Olympics Datathon - A Data Story-Telling Competition

## Welcome to the Datathon

The Olympics Datathon is designed to be an entry level, language-agnostic mini "hackathon". The focus of the datathon will be the explorative data analysis - or as we like to call it data storytelling - of the given Olympics dataset*. We invite everyone who is interested in data science to participate, regardless of their technical background. This one day datathon offers an interesting dataset to explore, guidance along the way and free pizza!

**Disclaimer**: This is an EDA and not a ML competition.

*Dataset will be published on October 16th.

## Competition Details

### Data Story-Telling Question

Will be published on October 16th.

### Resources

- **[Google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13HZpzjbAf9_MmwazE587eNhMCzWJcHXf?usp=sharing) skeleton code**
- [Python for data science](https://warwickdatasciencesociety.github.io/python-for-data-science/session-one/)  teaching session 1 by WDSS
- [R basics](https://github.com/warwickdatasciencesociety/into-the-tidyverse) 

### Submission

Submissions should be sent to [hackathon@wdss.io](mailto:hackathon@wdss.io). We accept any formats!

The competition will run from **6pm on Saturday the 16th October** to **6pm on Saturday the 23rd October**. No preference will be given to early entrants.

### Judging and Winning

We will judge submissions based on the insights they derive. If you can tell a story about the data with basic code, but elaborate observations that's actually slightly better than a super technically advanced submission with no elaborations at all. We will be looking for a good balance between code, visualizations and elaborations.

The winner/winning team will receive a shoutout on our [social media](#contact) accounts (including LinkedIn if you wish so). We will also link to your solution from this [GitHub](https://github.com/warwickdatasciencesociety) page.

## Help and Information

### FAQs

#### Is this a team or individual competition?

This is up to you to decide. If you would like to be part of a team, please contact Valentin Kodderitzsch on MS teams. We will try to our best to allocate teams of up to 4 people based on each participant's skill level. We will also be discussing teams during the Datathon introduction workshop which will be held on October 16th 2021 at 3pm in `OC0.01`.

#### I've improved my data story-telling submission since last submitting. Can I resubmit?

No problem. Simply email [hackathon@wdss.io](mailto:hackathon@wdss.io) and explain the situation.

### Getting Help

We will provide help throughout the datathon in a number of ways:
- Most help will be provided during the workshop on October 16th
- After the workshop you will find help by messaging the 'Get Help' channel on [Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3aVRNugWwFSGZDR5W0mMzRDXogLk8o9oVkKIKUOo6Hm5Q1%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=f388c915-9b20-4a56-9d3b-01b8070fdc6e&tenantId=09bacfbd-47ef-4465-9265-3546f2eaf6bc)
