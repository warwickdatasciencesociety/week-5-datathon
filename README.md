# Movie Mania Machine Learning Hackathon

## Welcome to the Hackathon

Hello and welcome to the hackathon! This is a beginner friendly event with focus on exploring key machine learning concepts. However, we also welcome more experienced participants to join. More experienced participants will have the opportunity to go beyond the basics covered in our teaching sessions. We will not hold you back when it comes to model complexity, data pre-processing and feature engineering. If you don't know what all these terms mean, don't worry we will explain everything in the teaching sessions.

This hackathon will span over 2 weeks. On Saturday February 12th, we will hold 2 teaching sessions on explorative data analysis and supervised learning. We will also release the competition dataset and a sample solution on that day. Participants then have 2 weeks to make a submission. About 1 week prior to the submission deadline we will host an online drop in session where you can ask for feedback. Throughout the 2 weeks you will always have the opportunity to ask for help on the hackathon teams channel.

- [Sample Pandas and Matplot lib notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/161cr-98PaHsSW_-BuURWwAo4eYXWHy33?usp=sharing) to be used for the EDA part of the ML notebook

### Submission

Please send a copy of your notebook to [hackathon@wdss.io](mailto:hackathon@wdss.io).

### Judging and Winning

We will judge your submission based on the quality of the notebook as well as how well your regression model performs.

The winner/winning team will receive a shoutout on our [social media](#contact) accounts (including LinkedIn if you wish so). We will also link to your solution from this [GitHub](https://github.com/warwickdatasciencesociety) page.

## Help and Information

### FAQs

#### Is this a team or individual competition?

This is up to you to decide. If you would like to be part of a team, please contact Valentin Kodderitzsch on MS teams. We will try to our best to allocate teams of up to 4 people based on each participant's skill level. We will also be discussing teams during the Hackathon introduction workshop which will be held on February 12th 2022 at 3pm in [S0.11](https://warwick.ac.uk/services/sg/spa/centraltimetabling/roominformation/centrallytimetabledrooms/capacity/s011/).

#### I've improved my data story-telling submission since last submitting. Can I resubmit?

No problem. Simply email [hackathon@wdss.io](mailto:hackathon@wdss.io) and explain the situation.

### Getting Help

We will provide help throughout the hackathon in a number of ways:
- Most help will be provided during the workshop on February 12th
- After the workshop you will find help by messaging the 'Get Help' channel on [Teams]()
- We will also host an online drop-in session on February 22nd
