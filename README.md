### FAQs

#### Is this a team or individual competition?

This is up to you to decide. If you would like to be part of a team, please contact Valentin Kodderitzsch on MS teams. We will try to our best to allocate teams of up to 4 people based on each participant's skill level. We will also be discussing teams during the Hackathon introduction workshop which will be held on February 12th 2022 at 3pm in [S0.11](https://warwick.ac.uk/services/sg/spa/centraltimetabling/roominformation/centrallytimetabledrooms/capacity/s011/).

#### I've improved my data story-telling submission since last submitting. Can I resubmit?

No problem. Simply email [hackathon@wdss.io](mailto:hackathon@wdss.io) and explain the situation.
